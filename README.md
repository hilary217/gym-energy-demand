# OpenAI Gym Environment for Energy Demand Management
This environment is for training agents to manage given energy demand by charging/discharging a battery.

A building at any given point in time has a some energy demand/usage in kW. A utility bill is calculated for industrial buildings (Factory, Office, Grocery Store, etc.) by taking the integral of that load curve - how much energy the building used. The other portion of the bill comes from taking the peak load over any 15 minute period over an entire month and multiplying that by a very expensive rate in excess of $1000/kW. While we cannot change the integral of the curve - without using less energy - we can however smooth out the curve and shave off the peak with the use of a battery that we can discharge from during periods of peak demand.
